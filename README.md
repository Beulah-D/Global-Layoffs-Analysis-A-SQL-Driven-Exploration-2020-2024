### Key Insights
1. Almost 263 companies laid off 100% of their employees.
2. High Vulnerability in Early to Mid-Stage Startups: A total of 32 companies in Series B, 19 in Seed, and 13 in Series C stages laid off 100% of their employees, indicating that early to mid-stage startups are particularly susceptible to economic downturns or misaligned business strategies.
